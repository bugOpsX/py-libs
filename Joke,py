"""
Jokes Generator Library

This module generates random jokes â€” programming, puns, or general jokes.
It currently uses a local dataset for simplicity, but can be extended
to fetch jokes from an external API in the future.

Usage:
    from jokes_generator import get_random_joke
    print(get_random_joke())

import random

# Local dataset of jokes (you can expand this list)
JOKES = [
    # Programming jokes
    "Why do programmers prefer dark mode? Because light attracts bugs.",
    "A SQL query walks into a bar, walks up to two tables and asks: 'Can I join you?'",
    "How many programmers does it take to change a light bulb? None, that's a hardware problem.",
    "I told my computer I needed a break, and it said 'No problem â€” I'll go to sleep.'",
    "Why did the programmer quit his job? Because he didn't get arrays (a raise).",

    # General puns
    "I used to play piano by ear, but now I use my hands.",
    "Why don't skeletons fight each other? They don't have the guts.",
    "I told my friend 10 jokes to make him laugh. Sadly, no pun in ten did.",
    
    # General jokes
    "Why donâ€™t scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!",
    "Why did the scarecrow get promoted? He was outstanding in his field.",
    "What do you call cheese that isn't yours? Nacho cheese.",
    "Why can't your nose be 12 inches long? Because then it would be a foot."
